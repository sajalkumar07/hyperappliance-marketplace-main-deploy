# HyperAppliance AIMs Marketplace Project Status

## Overview
This document outlines the current status of the HyperAppliance AIMs (Artificial Intelligence Modules) Marketplace project, a cross-chain platform for buying and selling AI modules. We've implemented key features according to the development plan, focusing on UI/UX, blockchain integration, and database structure.

## Current Implementation

### Completed
- ✅ Basic Next.js project structure with TypeScript and App Router
- ✅ Component architecture for the marketplace
- ✅ Dark mode support with automatic system preference detection
- ✅ Key UI pages:
  - Home page with hero section and featured listings
  - Marketplace browsing page with filters and search
  - Create listing page with form
  - User profile page with wallet management
  - My AIMs page with deployment management
  - About page with ecosystem information
  - Messages page with real-time messaging interface
  - Deployment page for launching AIMs on HyperBoxes
- ✅ Database schema design using Prisma ORM:
  - User model with multi-chain wallet support
  - AIM model for representing AI Modules
  - HyperBox model for compute nodes
  - Deployment and Message models
- ✅ Wallet integration:
  - EVM wallet connection (MetaMask, etc.)
  - Cardano wallet connection (placeholder)
  - Multi-wallet profile support
- ✅ Cross-chain support:
  - Configuration for EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Base)
  - Cardano integration architecture
- ✅ Redis integration:
  - Caching for AIM and HyperBox listings
  - Deployment tracking
  - Real-time messaging system
  - Session management
  - Rate limiting functionality
- ✅ API routes with Redis caching:
  - AIMs listing with filtering and search
  - HyperBoxes listing with compatibility matching
  - Deployment creation and status updates
  - Messaging and conversation management
- ✅ UI Components for Redis-powered features:
  - Enhanced AIM cards with deployment buttons
  - AIM listings page with filter and cache awareness
  - Deploy wizard with compatibility checks
  - Messaging interface with real-time updates
- ✅ Basic project documentation:
  - README.md with setup instructions
  - PROJECT_STATUS.md for progress tracking
  - .env.example with configuration options
- ✅ Initial Tailwind CSS integration with custom theme
- ✅ Responsive design for all pages and components
- ✅ SEO optimization with metadata for key pages
- ✅ Error handling and loading states throughout the UI
- ✅ Form validation for create listing and deployment forms
- ✅ User authentication flow with wallet signatures
- ✅ Node Manager client wrapper (`lib/hypercycle/nodeManagerClient.ts`) providing install/list/remove AIM functionality
- ✅ Replaced single-step deployment form with multi-step `DeployWizard` (Ethereum-only) for selecting AIM & HyperBox and initiating deployment
- ✅ Deployment service (`lib/hypercycle/deploymentService.ts`) wired into `/api/deployments` to install AIM images on Node-Manager and update status async
- ✅ Payment channel helpers (`lib/hypercycle/payment.ts`) plus React hook `usePaymentChannel` for opening/closing channels and checking balance
- ✅ Signed-request proxy (`/api/proxy`) and `useAimCall` hook with modal cost approval + EIP-191 signing via connected wallet
- ✅ Cost approval UX: global `CostApprovalProvider` with Chakra AlertDialog, integrated into `useAimCall` for user-friendly fee confirmation
- ✅ Messaging system fully wired: Redis-backed `/api/messages` + `/api/messages/conversations` endpoints, conversation indexing; front-end `MessagingInterface` now calls real APIs and auto-polls for new chats.
- ✅ Real-time messaging: Socket.IO server (`/pages/api/socketio`) streams `message:new` events; `MessagingInterface` subscribes via `socket.io-client` for instant updates (polling kept as fallback).
- ✅ Site-wide **chat drawer** (`components/ChatDrawer.tsx`) with floating button; resizable pop-out modal with expand/collapse & close actions, embedding the existing `MessagingInterface`.
- ✅ Built-in **"Hyper-T AI" assistant** conversation powered by OpenAI **Responses API** (`/api/assistant`, model `o4-mini`).  Graceful error handling & adjustable `effort` level; requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- ✅ Added **mock deployment mode** – `DEMO_DEPLOY=true` returns realistic fake deployments; `DeployWizard` extended with Node URL & Docker image inputs.
- ✅ Listing wizard: **USDC** currency option and Base-chain placeholder with validation/"coming soon" notice.
- ✅ Database integration with PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM:
  - Added `@prisma/client` runtime and `prisma` CLI
  - Implemented `lib/prisma.ts` helper
  - Replaced mock data in `/api/hyperboxes` & `/api/aims` with real Prisma queries + Redis cache
  - `/api/aims/upload` now persists new AIM rows (status `draft`) after manifest validation
  - Prisma schema already contains `AIM`, `HyperBox`, `Deployment`, etc. — pending initial migration & seed

## Redis Integration Details

We've implemented comprehensive Redis integration throughout the application:

### Caching System
- **AIM and HyperBox listings**: Cacheable for 1 hour with automatic invalidation
- **Cache-aware UI**: Components show optimized performance with cache hits
- **Cache utilities**: General-purpose caching methods with configurable TTL

### Messaging System
- **Real-time conversations**: Store and retrieve messages efficiently 
- **Unread message counts**: Track unread messages per conversation
- **Message history**: Efficiently store conversation history with time ordering

### Deployment Tracking
- **Deployment status**: Track AIM deployments from creation to completion
- **User deployments**: Associate deployments with users for easy lookup
- **Real-time updates**: Status changes reflected instantly in the UI

### Session Management
- **Auth sessions**: Secure user sessions with auto-expiry
- **Multi-device support**: Handle sessions across different devices
- **Wallet integration**: Link wallet sessions to user accounts

### Rate Limiting
- **API protection**: Prevent abuse of APIs with configurable rate limits
- **Per-user limits**: Differentiate limits based on user or IP address
- **Adaptive rate limiting**: Configure different limits for different endpoints

## Known Issues
- There are TypeScript errors due to missing type declarations and React dependencies. These are expected since we haven't installed the packages yet.
- The wallet connection functionality is implemented but uses placeholders for Cardano integration.
- Redis functionality is implemented but needs actual Redis connection setup.
- The project needs to be properly installed with `npm install` to function correctly.
- No actual connection to blockchain networks is implemented beyond wallet connectivity.
- Database connection is configured but requires actual PostgreSQL setup.

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Setup (Immediate Priority)
1. Install and lock dependencies (now includes `@prisma/client`, `prisma` CLI)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Provision PostgreSQL and run initial migration & seed script
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   npm run seed   # upcoming script
   ```
3. Code-generate strict TypeScript types for AIM `manifest.json` to enable shared validation.
4. Configure Redis connection in `.env` (e.g. `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379`).
5. Resolve remaining TypeScript errors after code-gen.
6. Add placeholder images and other static assets to the `public` directory.
7. Deploy to Vercel (preview) for initial testing and feedback.

### Phase 1.5: Hypercycle AIM Catalogue & Starter (new)
1. Import open-source AIM examples from `hypercycle-development/aim-examples` repo
   • Script `scripts/importAimsFromGithub.ts` hits GitHub raw URLs, validates manifest, inserts into Prisma (`status = 'catalog'`, `repoUrl` saved)
   • Adds default royalty address `0xf099A962b83d11af0A54E8baA9aD9dF879527BB1` if absent
2. Prisma migration
   • Add `repoUrl` (String) and ENUM `status { catalog, draft, published }` to `AIM` model
3. Backend
   • `GET /api/catalog` returns `AIM` rows with `status = 'catalog'`
4. Frontend
   • Marketplace page gains "Catalog" tab / filter
5. Starter AIM generator
   • Template with `Dockerfile`, `app/main.py`, `manifest.json` (echo endpoint) prefilled with royalty address
   • UI wizard collects module name + Docker tag → zips repo or pushes to GitHub
   • Generated manifest ready for DeployWizard flow

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Integration
1. ✅ Complete wallet connectivity (done for EVM, partial for Cardano)
2. Develop (OR USE PREXISITNG) smart contracts we can call via API for:
   - EVM-based chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Base)
   - Cardano blockchain
3. Create contract interaction services in the frontend
4. Implement full listing and buying functionality

### Phase 3: Backend API Development
1. ✅ Implement Next.js API routes with Redis integration (completed for key features)
2. ✅ Create authentication middleware (implemented basic structure)
3. ✅ Set up caching and optimization (implemented with Redis)
4. Connect to actual databases (PostgreSQL, Redis) for production

### Phase 4: Integration with HyperAppliance
1. ✅ Develop HyperBox registration flow (UI implementation complete)
2. ✅ Implement AIM deployment mechanisms (interface and tracking complete)
3. ✅ Create monitoring and management interface (deployed AIMs tracking)
4. Establish secure communication between marketplace and HyperBoxes

### Phase 5: Additional Features
1. ✅ Add real-time messaging between buyers and sellers (implemented with Redis)
2. Implement notifications system for deployments, messages, and transactions
3. Add AI Module verification and testing framework
4. Enhance filter and search functionality with AI-powered recommendations
5. Create analytics dashboard for AIM creators and HyperBox operators

## Deployment Plan
- Initial deployment to Vercel for frontend testing (ready)
- Redis setup on a cloud provider (Redis Labs, Upstash, or self-hosted)
- Smart contract deployment to testnets for integration testing
- Database setup on a PostgreSQL provider (Supabase, Railway, or Neon)
- Final deployment to mainnet chains with production backend

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1 week (Redis integration complete)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 1 week (basic API implementation complete)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 weeks

## Resources Needed
- Redis hosting service
- Smart contract auditing service
- PostgreSQL database hosting
- Blockchain node access (or service providers)
- Design resources for final UI polish

```bash
choco install postgresql15 --params "/Password:MyDbPass123 /Encoding:UTF8" -y
```
Chocolatey failed because:

• PowerShell is not running "as Administrator".  
• The package needs two Windows KB dependencies (2919355 / 2999226) that Chocolatey can't auto-install without elevation.

Because you can't elevate the remote shell from here, you'll need to run the installers manually.
